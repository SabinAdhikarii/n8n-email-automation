# AI-Powered Email Automation Agent

## 🌱 Overview
This project is my first attempt at building an **AI agent for email automation**.  
The goal was to explore how workflow automation tools, simple code, and AI can connect to create a system that handles client communication end-to-end.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **n8n** – workflow automation platform
- **Google Sheets** – data source for client information
- **JavaScript** – custom logic for personalization
- **Gmail** – sending automated emails

## 🚀 What It Does
The agent integrates multiple components to create a fully autonomous workflow:
1. 📊 Pulls client data directly from Google Sheets  
2. ✨ Uses AI/JavaScript logic to generate personalized email content  
3. 📬 Sends tailored messages automatically via Gmail  
4. 🔄 Updates records and manages the communication lifecycle  

## 📖 Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to structure workflows step by step in n8n  
- Understood how to merge automation with custom code  
- Gained insights into scalability, personalization, and tracking in client communication

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add retry logic for failed sends  
- Integrate analytics (open/click tracking)  
- Schedule recurring runs without manual triggers  
- Explore multi-channel outreach (LinkedIn, SMS, etc.)
